	<p>A long time ago, in a far away village, lived a little girl name Filipina but most people call <br>
	   her Pina. Pina was still young when her parents died so her Aunt Marta adopted so she can have <br>
	   a place to live in.</p>

	<p>Pina is a kind, hard-working and enduring while her Aunt Martha is lazy, mean and easygoing. <br>
	   When Pina was still young, she got sick but her Aunt Martha did not let her see a doctor and <br>
         be treated. It became a reason for her eyes to be hazy. She was forced to quit school because <br>
	   she can’t seem to read the lectures anymore. She simply satisfied herself by doing house chores <br>
	   and playing with other children.</p>

	<p>Months has passed, Pina’s eyes became even more blurry. She was almost blind. Most of the <br>
	   time, while they were playing hide and seek, the naughty kids do not find places to hide at <br>
         all. Instead, they just stand near Pina. Because she can’t clearly see them anymore, the <br>
         naughty kids were pinching her body while calling her names. Pina was just enduring all the <br>
	   nasty treatment everyone is giving her.</p>

	<p>One day while Pina was playing outside her Aunt Martha called angrily. “Pina, wash the dishes <br>
	   in the kitchen! You are such a lazy kid!” cried Aunt Martha. “After you clean the dishes make <br>
	   sure to wash the clothes!”</p>

	<p>Quickly, Pina left the things she was playing with and went to the kitchen to wash the dishes. <br>
	   Because of her sight, she accidentally tipped the other glasses and dishes over causing it to <br>
         break. When Aunt Martha saw the mess she became furious. She took the broom and bashed it on <br>
	   Pina’s legs.</p>

	<p>“You are so stupid! Your head should be surrounded by eyes so you can see everything near you!” <br>
	   yelled Aunt Martha while she still kept on bashing Pina with a broom.</p>

	<p>“Aunt Martha, please forgive me. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to do that” cried Pina. But Aunt Martha <br>
	   doesn’t seem to hear. She even bashed Pina with greater intense than before.</p>

	<p>When Pina could not tolerate the pain anymore, she ran outside while crying and went to the near <br>
	   woods. It was already dawn yet Pina hasn’t returned. “I bet she’ll come back if she’s hungry” <br>
	   said Aunt Martha to herself.</p>

	<p>The next day came and Pina was not yet home. Aunt Martha suddenly became worried so she asked <br>
	   the help of the other children to come and look for Pina. But she was nowhere to be found. <br>
         Some thought that she was kept by the fairy in the woods that pitied her.</p>

	<p>Few more days had passed but Pina never returned. One morning, everybody was surprised to see <br>
	   a plant grew at the front of Aunt Martha’s house. It has a head-shaped fruit and surrounded by <br>
	   something that resembles to the appearance of the eyes. Aunt Martha remembered what she said to <br>
	   Pina before she scolded her: “Your head should be surrounded by eyes so you can see everything <br>
	   near you!”</p>

	<p>“It is Pina!” one neighbor mumbled.</p>

	<p>One of the naughty kids curiously went near the plant. But when he tried to touch it, he was <br>
	   pricked by the thorns at the end of the leaves. They recalled the nasty treatment they gave <br>
         Pina. “It really is Pina,” said the naughty kid.</p>

	<p>”She doesn’t want anyone to get near her. We used to pinch Pina, now she’s getting back at <br>
	   us!” said by the other children. “It is her Pina! It is her Pina!” everybody shouted loudly <br>
         while they were all pointing at Aunt Martha.</p>

	<p>Since then, when neighbors pass by the plant and the fruit that shapes like a head with lots <br>
	   of eyes in it, they can’t help but say Pina’s name. Eventually, the name evolved into the <br>
	   word Pinya – Philippine’s local word for pineapple.</p>
