	<p>An Ox came down to a reedy pool to drink. As he splashed heavily into the water, he crushed a <br>
         young Frog into the mud.</p>

	<p>The old Frog soon missed the little one and asked his brothers and sisters what had become of him.</p>

	<p>"A great big monster," said one of them, "stepped on little brother with one of his huge feet!"</p>

	<p>"Big, was he!" said the old Frog, puffing herself up. "Was he as big as this?"</p>

	<p>"Oh, much bigger!" they cried.</p>

	<p>The Frog puffed up still more.</p>

	<p>"He could not have been bigger than this," she said. But the little Frogs all declared that the <br>
         monster was much, much bigger and the old Frog kept puffing herself out more and more until, all at <br>
         once, she burst.</p>
