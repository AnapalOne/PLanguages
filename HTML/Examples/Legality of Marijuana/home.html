						As we all know, marijuana is bad. But should it be legal? Actually, can it be legal? 
						Marijuana is used for some medical conditions with varying effect, but does it outweigh its side 
						effects? Currently, marijuana has been used in treating some medical conditions as a last resort. 
						But because marijuana is known as an addictive opioid, society is unclear whether or not it should 
						be legalized for medicinal use.
					</p>

					<p>
						Opioids are a class of depressants that are primarialy used in pain relief, but some opioids 
						are being used to treat coughing and diarrea. However, it is also a highly addictive drug. 
						Some notable examples include heroin, cocaine, LSD, and marijuana. These opioids are very 
						dangerous if taken only for its “pleasuring and feel-good” effects with continual use leading 
						to many complications like addictions, disablilites, and even death. Because of this, these 
						drugs are forbidden by law in most countries. However, in the case with marijuana or its other
						name, cannabis, studies show that there are therapeudic benefits from patients with mental 
						disorders and some medical disablilities.
					</p>

					<p>
						In a survey from an article on the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3998228/">National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI)</a>, 
						97% of respondents used cannabis primarialy for chronic pain with a 64% decrease in average 
						pain. Half of our respondents reported relief from stress and anxiety and nearly half of the 
						other respondents reporting relief from insomnia. In medical use, 71% of patients reported no 
						adverse effects, with 6% reporting cough or an irritated through and 5% fearing arrest in 
						using medical cannabis. In this conclusion, they suggest that cannabis as a medical drug is 
						a safe and effective way of treating chronic pain. In addition, and by quote, “Cannabis appears 
						to alleviate pain, insomnia, and may be helpful in relieving anxiety. ”
					</p>

					<p>
						From that, we can safely say that cannabis is safe and should be legalized, right? 
						If that were the case, then the drug would be legalized globally. However, some 
						countries have began making marijuana legal for recreational use. Canada, Mexico, 
						Georgia, Malta, Uruguay, Thailand, South Africa, and some states in the United States 
						have made it legal both in recreational and medical use, albeit with restrictions. 
						In most of the world, especially in Asia, marijuana is forbidden by law.
					</p>

					<p>
						In some states in the US, the use and possetion of marijuana is illegal. With the exception 
						for its uses in medical and recreational fields, you can be served jail time for a maximum 
						of a year and a minimum fine of $1,000 for a first offence. For a second offence, it increases 
						to a minimum of 2 years and a maximum fine of $2,500 and any subsequent offences after will 
						increase it to a minimum of 3 years and a maximum fine of $5,000. For the sale and production 
						of marijuana, you can be charged with 5 years to life in incarceration with a fine ranging 
						from $250,000 to $1,000,000.
					</p>

					<p>
						Public opinion over the legalization of marijuana has been slowly becoming more towards marijuana 
						being made legal. In the 20th century, an average of 80% of adults in the United States disagree 
						with allowing the use of marijuana and legalizing it. Beginning in the 2010’s, people have started 
						supporting the use of marijuana as it has some health benefits as well as being not as dangerous 
						as other drugs, like alcohol. The majority of these individuals are millennials (18-34, at the time 
						of 2015), with those disagreeing being mostly from the Silent Generation (70-87, at the time of 2015).
					</p>

					<p>
						With this steady rise in support of marijuana, why is it still banned in most countries around the 
						world? Some reasons may be due mostly to its highly addictive characteristic as a opioid, but some 
						claim that it may be due to racism. Despite this, more and more people have begun questioning whether 
						or not marijuana should be legalized. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSdjvEnyRzk" title="Richardson father risks freedom to promote cannabis treatments for his daughter">YouTube video</a> 
						that was published on 2017 showed that cannabis treatment have helped a father’s daughter treat her 
						severe anxiety. With more research being done and social media spreading its supposed health benefits, 
						people and governments may reconsider if legalizing marijuana will bring more good than the bad.
