						<h1>What is this website about?</h1>
						<p>
							This website talks about society's dilemma regarding the legality of marijuana. In some states in the US, marijuana is <b>illegal</b>. However, most states in the US and in countries like Canada, Georgia, Malta, and Mexico, it is legal for <b>recreational use</b> or medical use.

					<div class="question-answer">
						<h1>Why did you make this website?</h1>
						<p>
							This website was created because of a school project about creating a website about social issues. The one I chose was the legality of marijuana since I was interested about articles and videos I've watched and read on Youtube and other news outlets in the US's ban on marijuana or cannabis. In my research, I wanted to share what I learnt and understood to the world, so that you and other people would also learn. <br> <br>

							Another reason is just because I enjoy coding. It's my hobby. I'm interested in the techniques and process when it comes in developing websites, so I wanted to put my skills to the test.

					<div class="question-answer">
						<h1>What's so different between this and all the other websites/articles?</h1>
						<p>
							The difference is that this website is dedicated on informing you, the reader, about the legality of marijuana. This serves to help understand other people like you about for example, the countless debates and contriversies that go on in politics and videos online about its medical properties. This website is also a landmark for other articles that talk about topics similar to this.
